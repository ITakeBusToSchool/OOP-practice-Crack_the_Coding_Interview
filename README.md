***What is Object Oriented Programming?***


Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), 
which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including 
JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

A class is an abstract blueprint used to create more specific, concrete objects. Classes often represent broad categories, 
like Car or Dog that share attributes. These classes define what attributes an instance of this type will have, like color,
but not the value of those attributes for a specific object.

Classes can also contain functions, called methods available only to objects of that type. These functions are defined 
within the class and perform some action helpful to that specific type of object.

***Benefits of OOP***


OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures
Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs
Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism
Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them
Secure, protects information through encapsulation
